# Shopify Plus and Built for Shopify Compliance Guide

This guide ensures that the Supplier Price Watch application meets all requirements for Shopify Plus certification and the Built for Shopify program.

## Built for Shopify Requirements

### 1. Technical Requirements

#### API Usage

✅ **Proper API Versioning**
- All Shopify API calls use a dated version (e.g., `2024-01`)
- Version is configured centrally and can be updated easily
- App handles API version deprecation gracefully

✅ **GraphQL Preferred**
- Uses GraphQL for all compatible endpoints
- Falls back to REST only when necessary
- Uses bulk operations for large datasets

✅ **Rate Limiting**
- Implements backoff strategies for rate limiting
- Respects Shopify's leaky bucket algorithm
- Processes requests in batches to avoid limits

#### Authentication

✅ **OAuth Implementation**
- Uses standard OAuth flow for authentication
- Securely stores access tokens
- Implements token refresh mechanisms
- Uses app proxies appropriately

✅ **Session Management**
- Validates session tokens
- Implements session expiration
- Secures all session data

#### Performance

✅ **Efficient API Usage**
- Minimizes API calls through batching
- Uses webhooks for real-time updates
- Implements pagination correctly

✅ **Resource Management**
- Optimizes memory usage
- Manages background processes efficiently
- Implements caching strategies

### 2. App Experience

✅ **Embedded App Compliance**
- Follows Polaris design system
- Uses App Bridge for navigation
- Stays within Shopify admin context

✅ **Responsive Design**
- Adapts to all screen sizes
- Supports mobile admin usage
- Maintains usability on all devices

✅ **User Feedback**
- Provides loading states
- Shows clear error messages
- Confirms successful actions

### 3. Security Requirements

✅ **Data Protection**
- Encrypts sensitive data
- Does not store customer PII unnecessarily
- Implements proper data retention policies

✅ **Request Verification**
- Validates HMAC signatures
- Verifies webhook authenticity
- Prevents CSRF attacks

✅ **Access Control**
- Limits app permissions to only what's needed
- Implements staff account access controls
- Respects merchant collaboration roles

## Implementation Details

### API Interaction

```typescript
// GraphQL example for product updates
const updateProduct = async (productId, priceData) => {
  const client = initGadgetClient();
  
  return await client.mutate.shopifyProductUpdate({
    shop: context.shop,
    accessToken: context.accessToken,
    input: {
      id: productId,
      variants: {
        id: priceData.variantId,
        price: priceData.newPrice.toString()
      }
    }
  });
};

// Batch processing with rate limiting awareness
export const performBatchOperations = async (items, processFn, options) => {
  // Implementation includes:
  // 1. Backoff strategy for rate limits
  // 2. Concurrent request management
  // 3. Error handling with retries
  // 4. Progress tracking and reporting
};
```

### Plus-Specific Features

```typescript
// Script deployment example
export const deployShopifyScript = async (
  context: ShopifyContext,
  scriptConfig: ShopifyScriptConfig
): Promise<{ success: boolean; scriptId?: string }> => {
  const client = initGadgetClient();
  
  // Implementation connects to Shopify Plus Scripts API
  // and handles deployment, validation, and activation
};

// B2B pricing example
export const syncB2BPrices = async (
  context: ShopifyContext,
  items: PriceItem[],
  customerSegments: string[]
): Promise<{ success: boolean }> => {
  // Implementation handles B2B-specific price lists
  // and customer segment associations
};
```

### Security Implementation

```typescript
// Webhook verification
export const verifyWebhook = (request, secret) => {
  const hmac = request.headers['x-shopify-hmac-sha256'];
  const body = request.rawBody;
  
  const calculatedHmac = createHmac('sha256', secret)
    .update(body, 'utf8')
    .digest('base64');
  
  return safeCompare(hmac, calculatedHmac);
};

// Session validation
export const validateSession = async (session) => {
  // Implementation verifies session token
  // and checks for expiration
};
```

## Testing & Validation

A comprehensive testing strategy ensures compliance:

1. **Unit Tests**: Cover all core functions
2. **Integration Tests**: Verify Shopify API interactions
3. **Performance Tests**: Validate under load
4. **Security Scans**: Check for vulnerabilities
5. **Accessibility Tests**: Ensure WCAG compliance
