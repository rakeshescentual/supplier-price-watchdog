# Application Workflows

## Overview

The Supplier Price Watch application is designed around several key workflows that help users manage and analyze supplier price changes. This document outlines these workflows and their implementation.

## Core Workflows

### 1. Price List Analysis Workflow

```
Upload → Process → Analyze → View Results → Take Action
```

**Detailed Steps:**
1. User uploads supplier price list (Excel, CSV, or PDF)
2. System processes the file to extract pricing data
3. System analyzes price changes (increases, decreases, new items, discontinued items)
4. User views analysis results and insights
5. User takes action based on analysis (update prices, notify customers, etc.)

**Key Components:**
- `FileUpload` component for file selection
- `PriceTable` for displaying analysis results
- `AIAnalysis` for AI-generated insights
- Action buttons for various next steps

### 2. Shopify Integration Workflow

```
Connect Store → Match Products → Review Changes → Sync Prices
```

**Detailed Steps:**
1. User connects to Shopify store (or uses existing connection)
2. System matches supplier items with Shopify products
3. User reviews matched products and proposed price updates
4. User selects items to update and initiates sync
5. System updates prices in Shopify store
6. User receives confirmation of updates

**Key Components:**
- `ShopifyConnectionStatus` for managing connection
- `PriceTableFilter` for filtering items to sync
- `GadgetConfigForm` for optional Gadget.dev integration
- Sync confirmation dialog

### 3. Customer Notification Workflow

```
Select Changes → Configure Notification → Preview → Send
```

**Detailed Steps:**
1. User selects price changes that require customer notification
2. User configures notification parameters (timing, message, format)
3. User previews notification
4. User sends notifications via integrated channels (Email, Shopify, etc.)
5. System tracks notification status

**Key Components:**
- `PriceIncreaseNotification` for configuring notifications
- `GmailIntegration` for email notifications
- `GoogleCalendarIntegration` for scheduling
- Notification preview and templates

### 4. Market Analysis Workflow

```
Select Products → Fetch Market Data → View Comparisons → Adjust Strategy
```

**Detailed Steps:**
1. User selects products for market analysis
2. System fetches market data (requires Gadget.dev integration)
3. System displays competitive price positioning
4. User views market insights and recommendations
5. User adjusts pricing strategy based on market position

**Key Components:**
- `MarketInsights` for displaying market data
- `CompetitorPriceGraph` for visual comparison
- `PriceSuggestions` for AI-generated recommendations
- Market position indicators

## Example Implementations

### Price Analysis Implementation

```typescript
// Process file and analyze prices
const analyzeFile = async (file: File): Promise<AnalysisResult> => {
  // Extract data from file (format-specific)
  const data = await extractDataFromFile(file);
  
  // Match with historical data if available
  const matched = await matchWithHistoricalData(data);
  
  // Analyze price changes
  const analysis = analyzePriceChanges(matched);
  
  // Generate insights
  const insights = generateInsights(analysis);
  
  return {
    items: analysis.items,
    summary: analysis.summary,
    insights: insights,
    timestamp: new Date(),
  };
};
```

### Shopify Sync Implementation

```typescript
// Sync selected items to Shopify
const syncToShopify = async (
  items: PriceItem[],
  shopifyContext: ShopifyContext
): Promise<SyncResult> => {
  // Validate items before sync
  const validItems = validateItemsForSync(items);
  
  // Use Gadget.dev if available for efficient batching
  if (isGadgetAvailable()) {
    return syncViaGadget(validItems, shopifyContext);
  }
  
  // Fall back to direct Shopify API
  return syncViaDirectApi(validItems, shopifyContext);
};
```
