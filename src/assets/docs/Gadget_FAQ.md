## General Questions

### What is Gadget.dev?
Gadget.dev is a full-stack application development platform that simplifies building web applications. It provides pre-built connections, action frameworks, and background jobs that enhance the Supplier Price Watch application.

### Why use Gadget.dev instead of custom backend solutions?
Gadget.dev eliminates the need to build and maintain custom backend infrastructure while providing powerful features like PDF processing, data enrichment, and Shopify integration with minimal code.

### Is a Gadget.dev account required to use Supplier Price Watch?
No. The application is designed to work without Gadget.dev, but certain advanced features like PDF processing, background batch operations, and enhanced Shopify integration are only available with Gadget.dev.

## Configuration & Setup

### How do I configure the Gadget.dev connection?
1. Create a Gadget.dev account and application
2. Generate an API key with appropriate permissions
3. In Supplier Price Watch, go to Integrations â†’ Gadget Config
4. Enter your App ID, API key, and select environment
5. Save and test the connection

### What permissions does my Gadget API key need?
The API key should have permissions for:
- Reading and writing to your Gadget models
- Executing actions
- Accessing connected services (Shopify, email, etc.)

### Can I use multiple Gadget applications with Supplier Price Watch?
Currently, the application supports connecting to one Gadget.dev application at a time. For multiple environments (development/production), you can switch the configuration as needed.

## Features & Capabilities

### What Gadget.dev features does Supplier Price Watch use?
1. **Authentication Bridge**: Secure Shopify authentication
2. **PDF Processing**: Extract data from supplier PDF price lists

4. **Data Enrichment**: Add market information to products
5. **Background Jobs**: Handle time-consuming tasks asynchronously

### How does the PDF processing feature work?
Supplier Price Watch uploads PDF files to Gadget.dev, which processes them using OCR and structured data extraction. The extracted data is then returned in a format that can be used for price analysis.

### Can I use Gadget's background jobs for large datasets?
Yes. For time-consuming operations like processing thousands of products or performing market research, you can leverage Gadget's background jobs to run these tasks asynchronously without blocking the user interface.
